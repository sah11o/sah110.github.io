      <description>1 Introduction I am in Liège, Belgium, for the summers (Indian summers, May–July) for my internship at ULiège. I had to get a short-term Schengen visa to get here. Now, one blessed thing about the Schengen VISA is that it gives you access to (almost) all of Europe. Since this is my first time abroad, my plan was to visit a lot of places around Belgium during the weekends. Places like Amsterdam, Paris, Milan, Berlin etc.</description>

      <description>Hi!
This is my personal website, where I am not sure what I am going to do (blogs? research follow-alongs?). I am a third year undergraduate at IIT Kharagpur. My research interests lie in the fields of Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, Image Processing, Reinforcement Learning and Usable Security and Privacy.
My learning methodology in the above fields has always been engaging in projects and to pick up the required core concepts on-the-go.</description>
